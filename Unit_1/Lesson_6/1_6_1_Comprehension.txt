Explain in your own words what a class is (not just in Python, but in general).
A class is the abstract idea of a particular object.

What is an instance?
An instance is the tangible real-world representation of a class. The instances's attributes and methods have already been set according to it's class.

What's the relationship between a class and an instance?
It is the tangible real-world representation of a class

What's the syntax for defining a new class in Python?
class Class_Name():
	.....

What's the spelling convention for class names?
Capitlize the first letter

How do you instantiate (that is, make an instance of) a class?
Assing a class to a variable
ex--> my_instance = Class_Name(params)

How do you access the attributes and behaviors of a class instance (for instance, my_instace = MyClass())?
Use the "."(dot) operator
ex.--> my_instance.MyClass_method or my_instance.MyClass_attribute

What's a method?
A method is a function that has been defined inside a class

What is the purpose of self in Python classes?
The self paramter is used in the method definitions of a class, which takes the value of the instance calling the method in question.
This makes the method return values that are related only to the instance that calls it.

What is the purpose of the __init__ method? Give an example of how you could use it.
The __init__ method allows for a quicker way to create an instance of a class, instead of defining each attribute for each instance. 
Example:
class My_Class:
      def __init__(self, name, color):
	self.name = name
	self.color = color

>>> my_instance = My_Class("Vince", "Blue")


How can you use parent classes and inheritance to avoid code duplication?
define the parent class, and then define the child class (passing in the parent class as a parameter)
Example:
class Parent(object):
      .......

class Child(Parent):
      .......

Can child classes override properties of their parents?
Yes

What's up with the object in Python 2.7+ class definitions -- for instance class Foo(object):?
Object class is the parent of all classes in Python, so it's a good habit to have
